-- Individual Employee Duration  
The client can see each employee and their employment duration along with their job associations, which is useful when the client wants to find a correlation between employment length and job association. For example, the first few rows display the employees who have worked with her for the longest. Inactive employees are also displayed since their employment duration will help calculate the average. Using the report, the client can identify which job associations provide the longest employee retention. However, if the client wants to find the average employment length for each job association, the Categorized Average Employee Duration report will be more useful. Since this report is for individual employees, the client can find a specific employee to compare the average for the specific employee job associations. For instance, the client can find an employee who is a part-time and a cashier, then compare the employment length to the average of the category. She can then decide to increase employment length by increasing their wage or adding bonuses, knowing that the employee is reaching the average length for their category.
